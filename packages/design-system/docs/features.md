# Features

- **CSS-in-JS Library Agnostic** - Seeing as these are only typed variables and configuration values, we can easily use this in any CSS-in-JS library. We like `styled-components` & `styled-jsx` & `emotion`
- **Only 2 peer-dependencies** - Typescript (naturally) and polished (for some utilities to ease the load on modular scale, rem and em transformations)
